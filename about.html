                    <p>
                      I am Viraj Upadhyay, 17-year-old film enthusiast and a student who loves cinematography and technology. I have always been fascinated by the ways in which images can inform and trigger emotions, and what technology can do to a simple shot to make it cinematic. While all the films on this site were shot with just a smartphone, media software is what made raw footage transform into a way more immersive and polished film.

                    <p>
                      For me, filmmaking is about capturing mood, the moment, each tellable story behind an angle, cut, and light. I get excited about how technology can challenge these boundaries in the course of film production. You can produce quality with minimum equipment, but it is the selection of every shot, shadow, and sound to create the atmosphere that I would like to show.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I'm continuously learning how direction, editing, and technology come together to make films that are personal and refined. I believe that with the right tools and creativity, even the simplest setup can produce something powerful.
